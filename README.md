### Abstract

In a queueing system with an increasing load, this load cannot increase forever without compromising the efficiency of the system. Based on the open dataset of the call center of one anonymous bank, this work investigated the behavior of the efficiency of queue systems in several parameters, such as the variability of the average waiting time in the queue, the load on operators, and the number of customers who dropped a call without waiting for a response. As a result, we were able to observe how exactly the system stops coping with the load when it becomes too high. We have also found that the formulas of the classical queue theory do not fit the system represented by this call center.
